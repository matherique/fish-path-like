# Fish Path

## The problem

I like the way that [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) show the current working directory but I dont like the rest of it, so I did it to use in PS1 definition using "\$()"

## Usage

Just buidit with `go build` and add to PATH folder and use with "\$(binary-name)" instead "\w"
